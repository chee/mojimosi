## thanks

- to @InboxAppCo who made the MIT licensed [emoji extractor](https://github.com/InboxAppCo/extract-emoji) that's been subtree'd in, but is not a runtime dependency
- to @DavidBarts who made the [getfonts](https://github.com/DavidBarts/getfonts) package that's been illegally subtree'd in. they took a lot of flack for it on reddit because of _IANAL but EULA amirite_, and it's unlicensed so i've included their copyrighted code in this project.
- Mihai Potra whose MIT licensed find-color script is included here with some features removed to make it work for me
- everyone who made any of the dependencies
- the people i love and the people who love me and most especially the intersect
